/// oGHOST - BASE GHOST OBJECT - END_STEP EVENT (MOVEMENT & TURNING)
/// ===============================================================================
/// Purpose: Handle movement, turning, house logic, and speed management
/// Called: Every frame (third step event, after Step_0 and Step_1)
/// Parent: oGhost
///
/// This is the MOST COMPLEX event, handling:
/// 1. House state machine (getting out of ghost house)
/// 2. Speed determination (based on state and position)
/// 3. Turning at intersections (pathfinding to target)
/// 4. Wraparound handling (tunnel teleport)
/// 5. Elroy mode (faster pursuit when dots low)
/// 6. Direction reversal (for power pellet)
///
/// Structure: House logic → Speed → Turning → Special checks → Visibility

/// - housestate: Variable state machine (0-4) tracking progress within house
/// - Different ghosts may override this event with custom house logic
