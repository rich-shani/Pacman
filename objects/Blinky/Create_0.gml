/// BLINKY GHOST OBJECT - CREATE EVENT
/// ===============================================================================
/// Description: Initializes Blinky (Shadow/Red Ghost)
/// Personality: Aggressive pursuer - directly chases Pac's current position
/// Scatter Corner: Top-left (32, 32)
///
/// Features:
/// - AI chase/scatter/frightened behavior
/// - Grid-based pathfinding with tile tracking
/// - Elroy (faster pursuit) mode when dots are low
/// - Power pellet vulnerability
/// - Smooth animation with sprite flashing
/// ===============================================================================

// ===== ANIMATION VARIABLES =====
/// Animation frame index for sprite animation
im = 0;
/// Flash state when frightened (for visibility toggling)
flash = 0;

// ===== POSITION TRACKING =====
/// Current tile coordinates (16-pixel grid aligned)
tilex = 0;
tiley = 0;
/// Starting position (for reset/respawn)
xstart = 216;
ystart = 224;

// ===== PATHFINDING & BEHAVIOR =====
/// Target pursuit X coordinate (calculated from Pac position or pattern)
pursuex = 0;
/// Target pursuit Y coordinate
pursuey = 0;
/// House state: 0=released, 1=in ghost house
house = 0;
/// New tile flag: signals when ghost reaches a new tile for pathfinding update
newtile = 0;
/// About-face flag: when 1, ghost reverses direction (used for power pellet mode)

// ===== AI STATE MACHINE =====
/// Ghost state: 0=chase, 1=frightened, 2=eyes returning to house, 3+=special
state = 0;
/// Elroy threshold: when dots <= this value, Blinky enters faster "Elroy" pursuit mode

/// Corner X for scatter mode (top-left corner)
cornerx = 32;
/// Corner Y for scatter mode (top-left corner)
cornery = 32;

// ===== DIRECTION TRACKING =====
/// Current direction in degrees (0=right, 90=up, 180=left, 270=down)
direction = 0;
/// Cardinal direction: 0=right, 1=up, 2=left, 3=down (used for pathfinding)
dir = 0;
/// Fruit-related direction tracking (used during fruit chase modes)

/// Co-direction (secondary direction used in pathfinding logic)
